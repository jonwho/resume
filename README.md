A LaTeX journey

Version control my resume so I don't have to keep so many copies of the old ones on my computer. Maybe enjoy LaTeX, who knows.

Compile tex file with pdflatex to get pdf file.

Compile tex file with latex to get dvi file.

Run xdvi on dvi file to view file.

This serves as the repo for resume revision and the static site.

# Development

* `yarn build` to compile React components
* `yarn start` to serve page
* `sass --watch styles/` to preprocess to css

# WIP
